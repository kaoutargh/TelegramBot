attacks=""" 
In light of the recent uptick in strikes across Ukraine
follow guidance from local authorities, and refer to additional safety information from a previous Security Alert provided below:

If you hear a loud explosion or if sirens are activated, immediately seek cover.
If in a home or a building, go to the lowest level of the structure with the fewest exterior walls, windows, and openings; close any doors and sit near an interior wall, away from any windows or openings.
If you are outdoors, immediately seek cover in a hardened structure; if that is not possible, lie down and cover your head with your hands.
Be aware that even if the incoming missile or drone is intercepted, falling debris represents a significant risk.
After the attack, stay away from any debris.
Actions to Take:

Know the location of your closest shelter or protected space.
Follow the instructions from local authorities and seek shelter immediately in the event of mortar and/or rocket fire.
Depart Ukraine when it is safe to do so.
Ensure travel documents are valid and easily accessible.
Review safety and security alerts for U.S. citizens in Ukraine.
Have a contingency plan that does not rely on U.S. government assistance.
